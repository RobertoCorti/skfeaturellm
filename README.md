# SKFeatureLLM

SKFeatureLLM is a Python library that brings the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to feature engineering for tabular data, wrapped in a familiar scikit-learn–style API. The library aims to leverage LLMs' capabilities to automatically generate and implement meaningful features for your machine learning tasks.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🤖 LLM-powered feature engineering
- 🔌 Model-agnostic: works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- 🛠 Scikit-learn compatible API
- 📊 Comprehensive feature evaluation and reporting
- 🎯 Support for both supervised and unsupervised feature engineering
